# WinningJeopardy
# I'm writing this project on New Year's Eve and building on the hypothetical assumption that I would like to compete in Jeopardy. In order to gain any sort of competitive advantage, I'm going to take a look at a dataset of Jeopardy questions to see if I can figure out some patterns that might help me win (again - should I decide to compete).

# We're going to be using a dataset named jeopardy.csv containing 20000 rows. Here are the columns in the dataset and their explanation (and if you'd like to download it yourself, you can follow think link):

# Show Number -- the Jeopardy episode number of the show this question was in.
# Air Date -- the date the episode aired.
# Round -- the round of Jeopardy that the question was asked in. Jeopardy has several rounds as each episode progresses.
# Category -- the category of the question.
# Value -- the number of dollars answering the question correctly is worth.
# Question -- the text of the question.
# Answer -- the text of the answer.
# Let's go ahead and read in our dataset so we can explore its contents a bit.
